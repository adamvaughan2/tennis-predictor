This application uses a {model_info['model_type']} model to predict ATP tennis results. It was last updated on {model_info['date_created'].date()}
and has an accuracy of **{100*model_info['accuracy_test']:.1f}%** on the test set.

The dataset used for training and testing contains all ATP tour singles matches since 2000: over 60,000 matches.

The feature columns used in the model are: {set([x.split(' ')[0] for x in model_info['features']])} for each player.
